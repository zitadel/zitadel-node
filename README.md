# Node.js SDK for Zitadel

This is the Zitadel Node.js SDK, designed to provide a convenient and idiomatic
way to interact with the Zitadel APIs in Node.js. The SDK provides a seamless
wrapping of the Zitadel API, making it easy to authenticate service users and
perform API operations.

The SDK enables efficient integration with the Zitadel API, allowing you to
manage resources and execute actions. However, it's important to note that
this SDK is tailored for service users and is not intended for user
authentication scenarios. It does not support authentication mechanisms
like OAuth2, OIDC, or SAML for client applications, including web, mobile,
or other environments. For these types of user authentication, you should
use other libraries that are designed for the specific platform and
authentication method.

**Disclaimer**: This SDK is not suitable for implementing user authentication.
It does not handle authentication for client applications using OAuth2, OIDC,
or SAML and should not be used for scenarios requiring such functionality.
For those use cases, consider using other solutions that are designed for
user authentication across various platforms like web, mobile, or other
client environments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please be aware that this SDK is currently in an incubating stage. We are releasing it to the community to gather
> feedback and learn how it is being used. While you are welcome to use it, please note that the API and functionality may
> evolve based on community input. We encourage you to try it out and share your experiences, but advise caution when
> considering it for production environments as future updates may introduce changes.

## Getting Started

### Sign up for Zitadel

To use this SDK, you need a Zitadel account. Sign up at the official
Zitadel website and obtain the necessary credentials to access the API.

### Minimum Requirements

Ensure you have Node.js 20 or higher installed. You also need npm to
install dependencies.

## Using the SDK

### Installation

Install the SDK by running one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install @zitadel/sdk
```

## Authentication Methods

Your SDK offers three ways to authenticate with Zitadel. Each method has its
own benefits—choose the one that fits your situation best.

#### 1. Private Key JWT Authentication

**What is it?**
You use a JSON Web Token (JWT) that you sign with a private key stored in a
JSON file. This process creates a secure token.

**When should you use it?**

- **Best for production:** It offers strong security.
- **Advanced control:** You can adjust token settings like expiration.

**How do you use it?**

1. Save your private key in a JSON file.
2. Use the provided method to load this key and create a JWT-based
   authenticator.

**Example:**

```ts
import Zitadel, { ApiException } from '@zitadel/sdk';

const zitadel = await Zitadel.withPrivateKey(
  'https://example.us1.zitadel.cloud',
  'path/to/jwt-key.json',
);

try {
  const response = await zitadel.users.addHumanUser({
    userServiceAddHumanUserRequest: {
      username: 'john.doe',
      profile: {
        givenName: 'John',
        familyName: 'Doe',
      },
      email: {
        email: 'john@doe.com',
      },
    },
  });
  console.log('User created: ' + JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof ApiException) {
    console.log('Error: ' + e.message);
  }
}
```

#### 2. Client Credentials Grant

**What is it?**
This method uses a client ID and client secret to get a secure access token,
which is then used to authenticate.

**When should you use it?**

- **Simple and straightforward:** Good for server-to-server communication.
- **Trusted environments:** Use it when both servers are owned or trusted.

**How do you use it?**

1. Provide your client ID and client secret.
2. Build the authenticator

**Example:**

```ts
import Zitadel, { ApiException } from '@zitadel/sdk';

const zitadel = await Zitadel.withClientCredentials(
  'https://example.us1.zitadel.cloud',
  'id',
  'secret',
);

try {
  const response = await zitadel.users.addHumanUser({
    userServiceAddHumanUserRequest: {
      username: 'john.doe',
      profile: {
        givenName: 'John',
        familyName: 'Doe',
      },
      email: {
        email: 'john@doe.com',
      },
    },
  });
  console.log('User created: ' + JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof ApiException) {
    console.log('Error: ' + e.message);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Personal Access Tokens (PATs)

**What is it?**
A Personal Access Token (PAT) is a pre-generated token that you can use to
authenticate without exchanging credentials every time.

**When should you use it?**

- **Easy to use:** Great for development or testing scenarios.
- **Quick setup:** No need for dynamic token generation.

**How do you use it?**

1. Obtain a valid personal access token from your account.
2. Create the authenticator with: `PersonalAccessTokenAuthenticator`

**Example:**

```ts
import Zitadel, { ApiException } from '@zitadel/sdk';

const zitadel = Zitadel.withAccessToken(
  'https://example.us1.zitadel.cloud',
  'token',
);

try {
  const response = await zitadel.users.addHumanUser({
    userServiceAddHumanUserRequest: {
      username: 'john.doe',
      profile: {
        givenName: 'John',
        familyName: 'Doe',
      },
      email: {
        email: 'john@doe.com',
      },
    },
  });
  console.log('User created: ' + JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof ApiException) {
    console.log('Error: ' + e.message);
  }
}
```
